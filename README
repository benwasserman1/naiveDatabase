CPSC 350 Section 3
Assignment #5: Student and Faculty Database

List of source files:
  1. main.cpp
  2. Menu.cpp
  3. Faculty.cpp
  4. Student.cpp

Description of code limitations or deviations from the specifications:
  Note that the default values are included for simplicity and clarity when the databases are printed. It
  helps show format for when people need to set up the studentTable and facultyTable as files. ALSO, note
  that there are 3 extra menu options to be considered for some extra points!

Instructions for running:
  NOTE: The only instruction for running is that the files studentTable and facultyTable are set up like the
  default examples. When the program is run and either masterFaculty or masterStudent are printed, there will be
  a default example included. This way of setting up the file is required for the files to be read correctly. The
  files output at the end will be written to the files in this same way. Note that a comma and a space is used between
  advisees for faculty members.
